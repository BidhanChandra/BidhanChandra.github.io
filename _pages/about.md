I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the [Light and Molecules](https://barbatti.org/) group led by Prof. Mario Barbatti at Aix-Marseille Universit√©, France. Before joining L&M, I completed my PhD under the supervision of [Prof. Swapan K. Pati](https://www.jncasr.ac.in/faculty/pati) at the [Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research](https://www.jncasr.ac.in/) in Bangalore, India. As a computational photochemist, I specialize in organic emitters and non-adiabatic dynamics simulations. My current research integrates computational modeling and machine learning to design functional materials and accelerate non-adiabatic dynamics simulations.
