I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the [Light and Molecules](https://barbatti.org/) group led by Prof. Mario Barbatti at Aix-Marseille Universit√©, France. Before joining L&M, I completed my PhD under the supervision of [Prof. Swapan K. Pati](https://www.jncasr.ac.in/faculty/pati) at the [Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research](https://www.jncasr.ac.in/) in Bangalore, India. As a computational photochemist, I specialize in organic emitters and non-adiabatic dynamics simulations. My current research integrates computational modeling and machine learning to design functional materials and accelerate non-adiabatic dynamics simulations.

Open Source Contributions
======
I have experience contributing to [ULaMDyn](https://ulamdyn.com/index.html) a Python-based, open-source package designed to automate the unsupervised machine learning analysis of large datasets generated by NAMD simulations. ULaMDyn integrates seamlessly with the Newton-X platform and employs advanced dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques to uncover hidden patterns in molecular trajectories, enabling a more intuitive understanding of excited-state processes.
