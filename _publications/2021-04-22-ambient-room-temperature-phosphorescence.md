Triplet harvesting under ambient conditions plays a crucial role in improving the luminescence efficiency of purely organic molecular systems. This requires elegant molecular designs that can harvest triplets either via room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) or by thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). In this context, here we report a donor core-substituted pyromellitic diimide (acceptor) derivative as an efficient charge-transfer molecular design from the arylene diimide family as a triplet emitter. Solution-processed thin films of carbazole-substituted CzPhPmDI display both RTP- and TADF-mediated twin emission with a long lifetime and high efficiency under ambient conditions. The present study not only sheds light on the fundamental photophysical process involved in the triplet harvesting of donorâ€“acceptor organic systems, but also opens new avenues in exploring an arylene diimide class of molecules as potential organic light-emitting materials.
