A simple molecular probe displays highly selective turn-on response toward NO by the unprecedented NO-induced formation of a 1,2,3,4-oxatriazole ring exhibiting no interference from various endogenous biomolecules including DHA, AA, etc. Kinetics of the reactions between NO and the probe provide a mechanistic insight into the formation of 1,2,3,4-oxatriazole which showed that, though initially 1,2,3,4-oxatriazole is formed and extractable in solid form, it exists in equilibrium with the ring opened azide form which ultimately hydrolyzed and converted to carboxylic acid and nitrate. The reaction displays second-order dependence on [NO] and first-order on [Probe]. The probe is water-soluble, cell permeable, and noncytotoxic and appropriates for live cell imaging. This constitutes the first report where there is a direct evidence of NO-induced ring closing reaction of an acyl hydrazide moiety leading to the formation of 1,2,3,4-oxatriazole.
