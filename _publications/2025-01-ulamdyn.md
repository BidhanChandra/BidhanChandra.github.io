The analysis of nonadiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) data presents significant challenges due to its high dimensionality and complexity. To address these issues, we introduce ULaMDyn, a Python-based, open-source package designed to automate the unsupervised analysis of large datasets generated by NAMD simulations. ULaMDyn integrates seamlessly with the Newton-X platform and employs advanced dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques to uncover hidden patterns in molecular trajectories, enabling a more intuitive understanding of excited-state processes. Using the photochemical dynamics of fulvene as a test case, we demonstrate how ULaMDyn efficiently identifies critical molecular geometries and critical nonadiabatic transitions. The package offers a streamlined, scalable solution for interpreting large NAMD datasets. It is poised to facilitate advances in the study of excited-state dynamics across a wide range of molecular systems.
