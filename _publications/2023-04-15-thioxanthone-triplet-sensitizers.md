Photochemical activation by triplet photosensitizers is highly expedient for a green focus society. In this work, we have theoretically probed excited state characteristics of thioxanthone and its derivatives for their triplet harvesting efficiency using density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). Absorption and triplet energies corroborate well with the available experimental data. Our results predict that both the $$S_{1}$$ and $$T_{1}$$ states are $$\pi-\pi_{*}$$ in nature, which renders a high oscillator strength for $$S_{0}$$ to $$S_{1}$$ transition. Major triplet exciton conversion occurs through intersystem crossing (ISC) channel between the $$S_{1}$$ ($$^{1}\pi-\pi^{*}$$) and high energy $$^{3}n-\pi^{*}$$ state. Apart from that, there is both radiative and non-radiative channel from $$S_{1}$$ to $$S_{0}$$, which competes with the ISC channel and reduces the triplet harvesting efficiency. For thioxanthones with −OMe (Me=Methyl) or −F substitution at 2 or 2’ positions, the ISC channel is not energetically feasible, causing sluggish intersystem crossing quantum yield ($$\Phi_{ISC}$$). For unsubstituted thioxanthone and for isopropyl substitution at 2’ position, the $$S_{1}-T_{1}$$ gap is slightly positive ($$\Delta E_{S_{1}-^{3}n\pi^{*}}$$ ), rendering a lower triplet harvesting efficiency. For systems with −OMe or −F substitution at 3 or 3’ position of thioxanthone, because of buried $$\pi$$ state and high energy $$\pi^{*}$$ state, the $$S_{1}-^{3}n\pi^{*}$$ gap becomes negative. This leads to a high $$\Phi_{ISC}$$ (>0.9), which is key to being an effective photocatalyst.
