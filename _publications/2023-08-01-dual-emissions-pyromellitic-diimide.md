The realization of both thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from a single molecule is highly advantageous for efficient light-emitting diodes (LEDs). In this work, we have studied a donor core-substituted pyromellitic diimide (CzPhPmDI) derivative which shows both RTP and TADF. Apart from CzPhPmDI, we have studied heavy atom-substituted (on both donor and acceptor) CzPhPmDI and methyl-substituted spacer for improved RTP and TADF emissions. In the optimized geometry of CzPhPmDI, phenyl spacer is not completely perpendicular to both donor and acceptor, and dihedral angle is nearly $$60^{0}$$. From the dihedral angle-dependent studies of excited state property, we have found that a gradual increment of dihedral angle (more perpendicular to both Cz and PmDI) leads to lowering of singlet–triplet ($$\Delta E_{ST}$$) gap initially, but later it further increases the singlet–triplet gap (spacer is nearly perpendicular). With Me substitution on spacer (in CzMe2PhPmDI), the spacer becomes perpendicular to both Cz and PmDI groups. The increased $$\Delta E_{ST}$$ can be attributed to different excitation natures of $$S_{1}$$ and $$T_{1}$$. Further investigation suggests that it leads to the formation of a twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) state with increased coplanarity of the spacer with both the Cz and PmDI unit, which eventually leads to TADF with redshifted bright emission. While heavy atom substitution on donor does not influence the excited state characteristics, Br substitution on PmDI increases the spin–orbit coupling strength leading to improved intersystem and reverse intersystem crossing, which is beneficial for efficient RTP and TADF.
