Chiral organic phosphors with circularly polarized room-temperature phosphorescence (CPP) provide new prospects to the realm of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials, owing to the long-lived triplet states and persistent emission. Although several molecular designs show efficient room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP), realization of ambient organic CPP remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we introduce a chiral bischromophoric phosphor design to realize ambient CPP emission by appending molecular phosphors to a chiral diaminocyclohexane core. Thus, solution-processable polymer films of the trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane (DAC) chiral cores with heavy-atom substituted pyromellitic diimide phosphors, exhibits one of the most efficient exclusive CPP emissions with high phosphorescence quantum yield (≈18 % in air and ≈46 % under vacuum) and significant luminescence dissymmetry factor (|glum|≈4.0×10−3).
